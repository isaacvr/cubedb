There are three different types of pieces, centers, edges and corners. The centers are the pieces who define the color of that layer, since they are fixed (internally). Each layer has it's own name relative to the position that we're holding the cube (Front, Back, Left, Right, Up, Down). For instance, the name of the right face is the letter R. Since there are three posible moves that we can do in each layer (clockwise, counterclocwise, double turn), we call them in this case R, R' and R2."},{"type":"subtitle","content":"Step 1: The white cross."},{"type":"text","content":"To do the cross, we will first look at every edge that has a white sticker on it, and bring that piece to the opposite layer, the yellow one.
